# CrossFader
> Replaces fades between animations in Koikatsu with actual animated transitions


## Prerequisites  
- Afterschool DLC  
- Darkness DLC
- BepInEx 4 and above  


## Installation
Place **CrossFader** in BepInEx root folder.  
This is a BepInEx 4 plugin, to run it with BepInEx 5 you'd need [BepInEx 4 Patcher](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.BepInEx4Upgrader). (Included within HF Patch)


## Notes
- Since there are no fades between animations in VR, this plugin is extremely useful to prevent sudden and jerky transitions between animations in VR.  



## Credits
All credit of the plugin up to version 0.1 goes to the unknown developer who made this plugin.
