# CrossFader
> Replaces fades between animations in Koikatsu with actual animated transitions


## Prerequisites  
- Afterschool DLC  
- Darkness DLC
- BepInEx 4 and above  


## Installation
Place **CrossFader.dll** in BepInEx root folder.  
This is a BepInEx 4 plugin, to run it with BepInEx 5 you'd need [BepInEx 4 Patcher](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.BepInEx4Upgrader). (Included within HF Patch)  



## Notes & Limitations
- Since there are no fades between animations in VR, this plugin is extremely useful to prevent sudden and jerky transitions between animations in VR.  
- As a workaround to prevent the non-VR game from crashing when using the modified mono.dll for dnSpy debugging, animation fades are disabled during sex in 3P mode with two females. If you'd like to disable this workaround when not in VR, use the dll included in no-debug-fix.zip. (VR is not affected by this workaround)



## Credits
All credit of the plugin up to version 0.1 goes to the unknown developer who made this plugin.
